## Inspiration
> Falls are the main cause of morbidity and disability in the elderly. More than one-third of persons 65 years of age or older fall each year, and in half of such cases, the falls are recurrent. The risk doubles or triples in the presence of cognitive impairment or history of previous falls.

## What it does
Our smart walking cane uses sensors to detect whether or not someone is falling while using the cane.

## How we built it
* Arduino 101 with an accelerometer, touch sensor, button, and LED
* Arduino IDE
* Speech to Text recognizer 
* Node.js

## Challenges we ran into
* UiPath not connecting to IMAP, POP3, and SMTP
* SMS not sending through node.js
* Grammar in speech to text
* Google Cloud requires credit card
* Uneven coating of spray paint

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Making Arduino communicate with backend software

## What we learned
* Webkit
* Google Cloud
* UI Path
* Arduino IDE
* Node.js
* Spray painting

## What's next for Reacting Rod
* Improving general look
* Improving ergonomics
* Calibrating sensitivity of sensor using machine learning
* Incorporating companion app
* Making custom silicon with all the necessary sensors
